# ðŸ“˜ System Design Learning Repository

Welcome to my **System Design Learning Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of my notes, designs, and resources while learning **system design, database schemas, and architectural patterns**.  

The goal is to consolidate my learning and provide a structured reference for **interview prep** and **real-world design practices**.
